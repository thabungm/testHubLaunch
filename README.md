# Contact Us → Slack

A headless "Contact Us" feature (for testing). Given a submission with four
fields — **Name**, **Email**, **Subject**, **Body** — it validates the input and,
on submit, posts a formatted [Slack Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit)
message to a Slack **Incoming Webhook** URL stored in the `SLACK_URL` environment
variable. There is no web UI or HTTP server — "submit" means calling the exported
`submitContactForm(input)` function.

## Requirements

- **Node ≥ 22.6** to run `.ts` files directly (`node scripts/contact.ts`), or
- Any **Node ≥ 18** using [`tsx`](https://tsx.is/) (the `npm run` scripts below use
  `tsx`, installed as a devDependency, so they work on Node 20+).
- No runtime npm dependencies — the Slack call uses the global `fetch` (Node 18+).

Install the dev tooling (`tsx`, `typescript`, `@types/node`) once:

```bash
npm install
```

## Setup — export `SLACK_URL`

`SLACK_URL` is a Slack Incoming Webhook URL. It is a **secret** and is never
logged. The scripts read it from `process.env` only — they do **not** parse
`.env`. Export it first (`.env` is gitignored):

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
```

Or run inside the HubLaunch container, which already forwards `SLACK_URL`.

## Usage

### CLI smoke test — send a sample submission

```bash
npm run contact          # or: tsx scripts/contact.ts
```

Sends a fixed sample submission. On success prints
`Contact submitted to Slack (HTTP 200)` and exits `0`.

### Live test — real send + validation check

```bash
npm run test:contact     # or: tsx scripts/test-contact.ts
```

- **Test 1 (live):** performs a **real** Slack send via `SLACK_URL` and asserts
  HTTP 200. The subject includes an ISO timestamp so the message is easy to find
  in the channel: `PASS (live send): HTTP 200, body: ok`.
- **Test 2 (validation, no network):** confirms invalid input is rejected with a
  `ContactValidationError` and **no** Slack message is sent:
  `PASS (validation): rejected 4 invalid fields`.

Prints `ALL PASS` and exits `0` only if both pass. If `SLACK_URL` is unset it
prints `FAIL: SLACK_URL not set — cannot run live test` and exits `1`.

### Contact Us demo — static HTML page + live send

```bash
npm run contact:demo              # live send + writes contact-demo.html
npm run contact:demo -- --dry-run # skip the send; just write the page
npm run contact:demo -- --out=public/demo.html
```

Generates a **self-contained static HTML page** (default `contact-demo.html`)
that you open directly in a browser — there is **no HTTP server**. The page
shows the four-field Contact&nbsp;Us form (Name/Email/Subject/Body) pre-filled
with a sample submission, mirrors `validateContact`'s rules client-side for UX,
and previews the Block Kit payload. It makes **no** network request from the
browser.

By default the command also performs a **real, channel-visible** Slack send of
the sample submission via `submitContactForm()` and prints
`Contact submitted to Slack (HTTP 200)`; the authoritative server-side payload
and send result are embedded in the generated page. Use `--dry-run` (or
`--no-send`) to skip the live send while iterating on the UI, and `--out=<path>`
to change the output file.

The browser form only previews the payload — it cannot deliver to Slack (no
server, and client-side posting would expose the secret). Real delivery is
server-side only, and the `SLACK_URL` value is **never** printed or embedded in
the page. If `SLACK_URL` is unset, the page is still written and a secret-free
"not sent" result is reported (exit `1`; `--dry-run` exits `0`).

### Type-check

```bash
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit, strict
```

## API (`scripts/contact.ts`)

- `interface ContactInput { name; email; subject; body }`
- `class ContactValidationError extends Error` — carries `issues: string[]`.
- `validateContact(input)` — trims all fields; requires non-empty `name`,
  `subject`, `body`; requires `email` to match `/^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$/`.
  Collects **all** issues and throws before any network call.
- `buildSlackPayload(input)` — builds the Block Kit message (header + Name/Email
  fields + Message section) with a `text` fallback; escapes `&`, `<`, `>` in user
  input and truncates to Slack's limits.
- `submitContactForm(input)` — validates, then POSTs to `SLACK_URL`; resolves with
  `{ status, body }` (Slack returns `200` + `ok` on success).

## Notes

- `.env` stays uncommitted (gitignored); the webhook URL is never printed.
- Node < 22.6 cannot run `.ts` directly — use the `npm run` scripts (which use
  `tsx`) or `npx tsx scripts/...`.
